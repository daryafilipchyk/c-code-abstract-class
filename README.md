CIS4100 Assignment 10 1. Create an Abstract " Automobile" class that contains: • four private data members: o make o model o mileage o price (I leave it to you to decide the type) • "setters" and "getters" for each of the data (8 functions in total) • a print functions that is pure virtual. • a sameMake function. This function will have one Automobile argument and a Boolean return type 2. Create a class "car" that inherits from the class Automobile: o This class define the method print() that display that the automobile is a car, shows the make, model, mileage and the price. o The class has one default constructor (no arguments) o one constructor with arguments make, model, mileage and the price. 3. Create a class "truck" that inherits from the class Automobile: o This class define the method print() that display that the automobile is a truck, shows make, model, mileage and the price. o The class has one default constructor (no arguments) o one constructor with arguments: make, model, mileage and the price. 4. The main Use the main method to test your classes and methods, creating instances from all the classes (except the abstract you will have to use a pointer). It is up to you to decide a good demonstration of all the functions defined.
